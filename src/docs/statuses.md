These can be used both for components and documentation pages. Refer to the Fractal documentation](https://fractal.build/guide/core-concepts/statuses.html#default-statuses) for more information.

## Component statuses

The correct status should be applied to all components and their variants.

### WIP

This is currently in development and should not be included in a live project.

### Prototype

This has been built and tested by the developers and may be used in limited live instances to gather usage data.

### Ready

This has been fully tested and has sufficient evidence to show that it is fit to be used in live projects.

### Invalid

This is an invalid combination of component properties (e.g. styles or child elements) that is not to be used. It is included for illustration purposes only.

## Documentation statuses

### WIP

Currently in draft.

### Ready

Published and ready to reference.
