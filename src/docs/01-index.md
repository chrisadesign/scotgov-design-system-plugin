title: Pattern library
---
All components for the [Digital Scotland Design System](https://designsystem.gov.scot/) with additional developer documentation.

## Fractal

The pattern library uses [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) to present the components and documentation in a format suited to development and collaboration. The [Fractal documentation](https://fractal.build/guide/) provides detailed guides on creating components and documentation.

## Nunjucks

The pattern library uses the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templating engine to display the components from JSON data sources. Detailed documentation can be found in the [Nunjucks templating documentation](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html).
