## Pagination for smaller display widths

Limit the number of pagination links shown at once, to reduce the chances of wrapping on multiple lines at smaller widths.

Alternatively replace the pagination links with a 'load more' button at smaller widths and dynamically show additional content each time the button is triggered.
