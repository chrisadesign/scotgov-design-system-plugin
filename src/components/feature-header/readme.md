# Notes

Summary text content is optional.

## Variants

### Grey
The component has a grey background and padding is added around the text content.

Can be used in combination with "wide."

### Wide
The text content takes up 2/3 of the available space; the image takes up 1/3.

Can be used in combination with "grey."

### Full image

The image is applied across the entire component. Text is overlaid on top of the image.

Gives the title element a solid white background and aligns the text content to the upper left of the component.

These two modifiers should only ever be used together and not independently.

Can be used in combination with "wide."
